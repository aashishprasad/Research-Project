Set shortly after the final chapter of Naruto, the miniseries focuses primarily on Sarada Uchiha, the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura, who accompanies Naruto on a mission as she seeks to learn about her parents while combating a mysterious antagonist with ties to Orochimaru and the Uchiha clan. The story acts as a prelude to the 11th Naruto film, Boruto: Naruto the Movie. The collected tankobon volume was released on August 4, 2015, in Japan. The story takes place 15 years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, with Sarada trying to find out the truth behind her suspicions.","other","November","2010"," E10+",5.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,2,2,3,1,4,3,6,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Naruto_media"
